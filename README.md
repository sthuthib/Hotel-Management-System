# Hotel-Management-System
In this project, “ONLINE HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” I have tried to show how the data/information in HOTELS is managed . This is just an overview of management in hotels. Customers are provided with different services like booking rooms, canceling rooms etc. This website of hotel will remove the hectic task of customers and executives for searching and booking rooms in hotels. Customer can book rooms in advance seating anywhere across the world. It also gives information regarding the availability of rooms, staff records and the corresponding actions related to it like adding new rooms, staff records, deleting and updating them as well.
This project aims at creating a hotel management system which can be used by customers to reserve hotel rooms and facilities. This software package has been developed using the powerful coding tools of PHP and MYSQL (WAMP) server.
